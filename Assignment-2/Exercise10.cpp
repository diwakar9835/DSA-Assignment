// EXERCISE: 10

// A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.  
// Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
// You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.    
// You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

// Solution

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int findPeakElement(vector<int>& nums) {
    int left = 0, right = nums.size() - 1;
    
    while (left < right) {
        int mid = (left + right) / 2;
        
        if (nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) right = mid;
        else left = mid + 1;
    }
    return left;

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 1};
    cout << findPeakElement(nums);
